# Config Docs

Pick the **config schema version** your server is using.  
If you’re not sure, open your `config.yml` and check the **last line**; it will look like:

```text
# CONFIG VERSION V9, SHIPPED WITH V2.1.5
```

> Start here:
- **[v9](/config/v9/)** — ships with **DiscordLogger v2.1.5** (and later compatible versions)

_This page will list more versions (v10, v11, …) as they’re released._

> At the moment, this page only supports config versions starting with v9
